# Chat models

[Chat models](/oss/concepts/chat_models) are language models that use a sequence of [messages](/oss/concepts/messages) as inputs and return messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text). These are generally newer models.

<Info>
**If you'd like to write your own chat model, see [this how-to](/oss/how-to/custom_chat_model/).**

If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing/how_to/integrations/).

</Info>

<ChatModelTabs overrideParams={{openai: {model: "gpt-4o-mini"}}} />

```python
model.invoke("Hello, world!")
```
